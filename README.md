Math Parser using Shunting Yard Algorithm modified to be able to solve complex parentheses, and decimal numbers with precision up to 100 digits ( i can increase this but I haven't found a solution to show all the numbers ).
FEATURES
  + Basic Mathematic (+,-,*,/)
  + complex parentheses (you can add infinite amount of brackets, the program will check if it's legit)
  + Identify Math Error and Syntax Error
  + Calculating with Decimal, Negative Number.
  + Calculate Power (i have coded this feature but haven't added a button to do it in the UI)
UPCOMING FEATURES (That i will add if i feel like it)
  + Trigonometry
  + Logarithm
  + Solve for x (this will be very challenging)
  + LCD/LCM
  + Quadratic Equation solver
  + ... and many more that i haven't thought of.
